            Usada Pekora (兎田ぺこら) is a female Japanese Virtual YouTuber
            associated with hololive as part of its third generation of VTubers
            under the name of "hololive Fantasy" (ホロライブファンタジー)
        </p>
        <p>
            Pekora is infamous for mischief, to the point where other Hololive
            members will instantly become suspicious of any project if they learn
            that Pekora was involved. However, her pranks are never mean-spirited,
            and she will usually stop before causing actual harm. She has a distinctive
            laugh ("AH↓ HA↑ HA↑ HA↑") and frequently interjects her sentences with the "-peko" suffix.
        </p>
